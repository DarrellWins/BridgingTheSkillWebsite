#Bridging The Skill 
a Python-based resume generator project that aims at assisting older adults to transform their life and volunteer experience into professional, skill-based resume bullet points. The user describes experience in straightforward words, picks the key skill that it emphasizes and the program rephrases it in a variety of resume-ready phrases using strong action verbs. Its aim is to lessen obstacles to work by simplifying, demystifying, and simplifying the resume writing procedure in the event that the individual might have a difficulty with the conventional resume format or lingo.
